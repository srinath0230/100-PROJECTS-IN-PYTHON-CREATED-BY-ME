In function when we "return" value it is considered to be the end of that function, to have multiple "return" statments we should use if condition.
(The return keyword will exit the function and prevent the rest of the code from being executed.)

Docstrings = writing the defination of the function right below after decleration of the function. It gives the defination of the function written by you. It is 
written in between the thriple quotes
Exampple : 
          def sum(n1,n2):
          """adds two number"""
          
Print VS Return : print gives the output in console and doesn't store that value and return helps to store the value as variable and can be reused in the further code.

Recursion = The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called a recursive function.
