When looping through a dictionary, the return value are the "KEYS" of the dictionary.

We can use "while" loop with a condition "True" until the desired result is achieved and then turn the condition into "False"

To add key and values into empty dictionary we need to simple follow this stepp : dictionary_name[key] = value 
for example : 
            bids = {}
            repeat = True
            while repeat:
              name  = input("Enter the name of the bidder :")
              price = int(input("Enter the bid price : $ "))
              bids[name] = price
              new_bidder = input("Are there any other bidders? Type 'yes' or 'no'\n").lower()
              if new_bidder == "no":
                repeat = False  
            print(bids)
