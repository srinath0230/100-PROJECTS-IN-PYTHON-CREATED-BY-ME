alphabet = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']
Use the modulo operator to make sure that the alphabet loop runs and cannot be restricted to 26 shift numbers.

MODULUS OPERATOR IMP POINTS : modulo operator divides the number and giving the reminder as result 
if the number which we are diving is less then it simply return the number (for example 3%4 results in 3 as output)

WHILE LOOP : To run something forever we set it True (It helps tp prompt the user agian and agian until the condition is reached)
once the condition is fullfilled we need to use If-else loop and turn the True condition to Flase
